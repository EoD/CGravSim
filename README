cgravsim v0.9

A program to calculate gravitational effects with relativistic corrections!


INSTALLATION

  It's recommended that you use the frontend JGravSim.jar from

	  http://jgravsim.eod.xmw.de/

  Essentially you need nothing except for a properly prepared wpt file
  (you should only have ONE step in the file) and the cgravsim executable.


BUILDING

  Usually you should use the following command in order to produce the best
  executable for your system
	
	make auto

  It is also possible to produce architecture specfic files and some other
  funny stuff. Have a look at

	make help
